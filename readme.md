# Hexenkatze

A 2D-based Android offline game with a witch cat theme that tries to regain its lost strength so that it can defeat dogs that make witch cats lose their power. To restore strength, the cat witch collects sword items until the sword bar is full. Of course the dog will obstruct the witch cat by attacking the cat in gathering its strength. Witch cats will be prevented from drop items and dogs that will attack which makes the HP bar run out.
